JavaScript is a high-level, interpretative programming language that powers many modern web applications. JavaScript is seated next to CSS and HTML as core technologies fueling the World Wide Web, bringing interactivity to styles and markups.

But the web did not always have JavaScript.

## History of JavaScript

The National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) released _Mosaic_, one of the first popular graphical browsers for the web, which aided the expansion of the World Wide Web, which was just 3 years old at the time.

In 1994, _Mosaic Communications_ was founded by many of the NCSA _Mosaic_ authors, with the intent of creating _Mosaic Netscape._ Within four months of its late 1994 release, _Mosaic Netscape_ had taken over the browser market.

Following the success of _Mosaic Netscape_, _Mosaic Communication_ changed their name to _Netscape Communication_ and renamed their browser to _Netscape Navigator_, in an effort to avoid legal troubles with the NSCA. At this same time, the ground work for what will become JavaScript is also lain.

### The Beginning

Brendan Eich was recruited in 1995 by _Netscape Communications_ to embed the _Scheme_ programming language into _Netscape Navigator_. But before this could occur, _Netscape_ collaborated with _Sun Microsystems_ to include their programming language into the browser, Java. _Netscape_ wanted a language that would compliment Java and that included similar syntax to Java, which caused other programming languages, such as Perl, Python, and Scheme to be excluded from filling this need.

In 10 days, Eich wrote a prototype of JavaScript to defend against the proposals of other programming languages. JavaScript, then known as LiveScript, was released in the browser in September of 1995.

LiveScript was renamed to JavaScript in December 1995 to feelings of confusion and the impression that this new language was connected to the Java programming language. This new name was deemed as a marketing ploy by _Netscape_ due to the rise in popularity of the Java language on the web at the time.

### Standardization

JavaScript was presented to _ECMA International_ in 1996 to create a standard specification of the language that could be implemented by other vendors. This led to the release of the ECMAScript language specification in 1997, with JavaScript being the most well-known implementation of the standard.

The ECMAScript language specification has been incrementally updated since itâ€™s original release. Due to nearly a decade of issues, ECMAScript version 4 was abandoned and the release of ECMAScript version 5 (ES5) created the modern baseline for JavaScript.

ECMAScript releases from ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and onwards are treated differently in the browser. In an effort to battle the slow implementation of new JavaScript features in the browser, ES6 and beyond JavaScript is transpiled into its ES5 counterpart using tools such as [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).

## The Future

With such a large impact on modern web browsing, it is hard to believe that the first version of JavaScript was produced in a mere 10 days. And, while much has changed since the initial prototype was released in 1995, the future continues to look bright for JavaScript as an essential language for the web.
