            <div class="date">March 08, 2017</div>
            <hr>
            <p>Once upon a time, I dedicated most of my time, and most of my money into a band.
                <br>While we were not anything spectacular or noteworthy, and surely not on the cover of any magazines or featured
                in any articles, we had a ton of fun doing it. But at some point, you have to give up, and realize it is
                time to start being an adult, or eventually you end up like this at all the local shows:
                <br>
                <img class="small-images" src="./images/fellowkids.jpg"> </p>

            <p>As time has gone on, I have started to realize just how much playing in a band has impacted my career and helped
                me understand business.
                <br> Sure, there is the marketing aspect, branding, logos, making t-shirts for your parents and family friends
                to buy, but on a deeper level, playing in a band has helped me with core skills to help me on my path in
                business.
            </p>

            <p>Finances, first and foremost, was the biggest skill I learned. If you can manage a budget for five guys to live
                off of ten dollars a day while on a tour of the upper midwest, and try to turn some sort of profit (we didn't),
                then you can budget just about anything.
                <br> Maintaining that budget, which included money for new shirts to sell, gas, food, and a way to kill the endless
                hours of free time in between playing shows and driving, was a challenge, there is also fees to pay for the
                design of the shirt you just had printed, costs for promotion for the tour (Facebook Ads are not cheap),
                a manager you have to pay, and countless other costs, all paid for by a handful of guys with not much expendable
                income. </p>

            <p>The next skill set I learned was negotiation, and how to get what you want and need.
                <br> Too often promoters will promise pay outs and good crowds, and amenities that sound beyond anything anyone
                would expect, only to be let horribly down when it came time to pay up or cash in on your earnings.
                <br>Too often a venue is portrayed as big and clean with an amazing sound system and always packed, to find out
                you are playing some dive bar in a bad part of Indianapolis to 3 people, all of which are belligerently drunk,
                and you are told you will not be paid out your guarantee for the night. Naturally, most people will not be
                happy about the lies and deceit, but unfortunately, it happens all too often and is almost an accepted practice
                among the local band scene.
                <br>You take what you can get and just move on. But what happens when you go against the norm?</p>
            <p>You challenge these promoters and hold them to expectations that they set for themselves.
                <br>Often, it blows up in your face, you get pulled from the show, blacklisted from further shows, and every
                other conceivable form of punishment they can deliver to you.
                <br>But other times, you get the respect that you deserve, especially if you are an influential force to be dealing
                with.
            </p>

            <p>In another situation, we played in a show with a touring act, three supports for the tour, and half a dozen local
                bands.
                <br>The show sold well, but as the local bands played on, the tour package was still nowhere to be found.
                <br>The promoters also had not shown, despite telling everyone they were coming, and everyone was starting to
                get anxious.
                <br>Naturally, we took charge, we collected the door, designated set times and change overs, gave the locals
                a cut of the door profit (well above what they would have made if the promoter showed), and started a realization
                with these bands that they do not need to be screwed over to succeed.</p>

            <p>We pulled together a show that still sold well, that was arguably less stressful, was done the way every band
                wanted it to be done, even with all the set backs. Leadership, promoting and marketing skills, communication
                skills, and budgeting were all extremely prevalent in my time of playing in bands, and ultimately, it helped
                to shape me into a better leader.</p>

            <p>Not so much of a waste of time, now was it?? Have you learned business and leadership skills from playing in
                a band, or any other hobby you may have been passionate about?</p>
