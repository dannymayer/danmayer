            <div class="date">March 29, 2017</div>
            <hr>
            <img class="small-images float-left" src="./images/meeting.jpeg">
            <p>Facebook is one of the most popular social networks available today, with over 1,870 million active user, and
                outranking the closest three networks by quite a bit, it would only make sense to utilize Facebook as a platform
                to promote and develop your brand, business, band, youtube channel, or whatever it is that you may be creating.
                For more information on the growth of Facebook and how it compares to other social networks, check out this
                article I wrote
                <a href="./the_relevance_of_social_media_in_2017.html">here</a>. </p>
            <p>But, with all the accessibility Facebook brings, it does limit reach on band and business pages, in part to promote
                using Facebook Ads, and in part as to not flood their users News Feedswith a million of the same posts, even
                if that user willingly "liked" a page in order to receive more content from that source. So how does the
                algorithm that Facebook uses work? This picture from Tech Crunch sums up the formula pretty well and if you
                were interested in diving a little deeper into the workings of this algorithm, check out their article all
                about
                <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/06/ultimate-guide-to-the-news-feed/" target="_blank">it here.</a>
            </p>

            <img class="large-images" src="./images/facebook-news-feed-equation-1024x582.png">
            <p>So all of those people you strived hard to convert and get involved with your brand on Facebook will be for nothing,
                to an extent. A user can set specific pages to always populate their feed whenever a new post has been made,
                but it was hard enough to get them to "like" the page in the first place. You can always turn to Facebook
                Ads, but even promoted posts do not always come with the best results. So what do you do? Check out some
                of the hacks to get your brand to reach its audience, despite the forces currently and soon to work against
                you.
            </p>
            <h2>1. Use Audience Targeting to Ensure the Right People See your Content</h2>
            <p>Under the general settings tab of your page, you can select an option called Audience Optimization for Posts.
                TURN THIS ON!</p>
            <br>
            <img class="large-images" src="./images/facebook-settings.png">
            <p>After you turn this on, when you go to write posts, you can specifically target your audience, by age, gender,
                interests, and locations. This is a huge benefit.</p>

            <img class="large-images" src="./images/audience-optimization.png">
            <p>This means that your post will only show to those who you specifically want to see it, so you can hone in more
                on niche and, while it may not directly increase the amount of people seeing your post, at least you know
                that the ones who do see your posts will be the ones you are hoping see it.</p>
            <h2>2. Create a Facebook Group for your Brand</h2>
            <p>A Facebook group is basically like a forum used for multiple purposes. People choose to join these groups, which
                are based on interests, communities, brands, or maybe even an internet famous dog. Everything posted in a
                group appears in a persons Newsfeed, without an algorithms blocking the content, unless a user specifically
                changes that. So what does this mean for your brand? That you now have a forum to not only discuss your brand,
                share behind the scene events and actions, communicate more directly with your audience, and, most importantly,
                an unfiltered way to share your content. You can invite users to a group much like you would a page, and
                you can set admins to block or get rid of anyone who may not have your brands best interest in mind (We all
                know how much damage an internet troll can do).</p>
            <p>Not only is this a great way to build a sense of community around your brand, but it also allows you to get closer
                with your audience then you would be able to on a Page and it allows for unfiltered interactions
            </p>
            <h2>3. Keep your Posting Time and Frequency in Mind</h2>
            <p>When do you post? Are you scheduling posts? Or do you post whenever you have something to post without strategically
                planning? The standard I always used to use for posts was four times a day, at 11a.m. 1p.m. 5p.m. and 7p.m.
                According to research on an article on
                <a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/facebook-marketing" target="_blank">Buffer Social</a>, this may not be ideal. The following is a graph depicting interactions and posting frequency
                based on the time of day.</p>

            <img class="large-images" src="./images/Graph1PostFreqandEffectTOD.png">
            <p>It would make sense to assume that posting during the highest periods of traffic would allow for the largest
                potential reach on your posts. Wrong. While you and everyone else are posting at these times, your content
                is being drowned out by competition. Post while people are asleep or away. This allows for the potential
                for your post popping up on one of the first bits of a persons news feed, instead of fighting for whatever
                little bit of recognition that can be attained through the mass of incoming information. It is also best
                to limit your Facebook posts to 2-3 times a day.</p>
            <p>Another factor of Facebooks algorithm is feedback, and attention created when a post is seen. If there is low
                engagement by the audience that does see your post, your posts will be less likely to be seen going forward.
                Also, if there is any negative feedback or attention on your post, Facebook will automatically withdraw the
                reach of that post. On top of that, Facebook should be more casual then Twitter, and therefore, limiting
                posts is ideal, and no one wants to see anything that can be viewed as spam.</p>
            <h2>4. Create Evergreen Content</h2>
            <p>Evergreen content is a crucial component to getting consistent visibility on any network, and Facebook is no
                different. What is evergreen content? Content that never goes bad or gets outdated. It can be as simple as
                how-to guides or beginners guides to your niche, to in depth tutorials over certain products, or informative
                and useful infographics. Whatever you decide to make, make it well and make it often. Evergreen content has
                great potential to go viral, plus is always useful, therefore can always get shares, likes, engagements,
                and links back to your page.</p>
            <p>Your evergreen content will largely depend on your niche and what you can provide for it but some examples of
                evergreen content include:
                <ul>
                    <li style="text-align: left;">Interviews</li>
                    <li style="text-align: left;">How-To's</li>
                    <li style="text-align: left;">Infographics (depending on content)</li>
                    <li style="text-align: left;">History or timeline posts</li>
                    <li style="text-align: left;">Useful link posts that can be used as a resource</li>
                    <li style="text-align: left;">biographies</li>
                    <li style="text-align: left;">Reviews</li>
                    <li style="text-align: left;">Personal research posts</li>
                    <li style="text-align: left;">Case Studies</li>
                    <li style="text-align: left;">Check lists</li>
                    <li style="text-align: left;">List of free and paid tools</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>The list of evergreen content and what you can do to produce evergreen content is endless. But above all, make
                sure it is quality and aimed to help. Don't overdo the posts, and make sure people know about the posts once
                they are published. They are absolutely essential in driving traffic.</p>
            <h2>5. Share Your Posts (And Get Others to Share Them)</h2>
            <p>While this may seem obvious, do not underestimate the power of your personal social reach. Have you and your
                team share your posts. This way your friends (and hopefully your audience) will see these posts. You can
                also use this as a way to build your clients. There are potentially others in your audience right in your
                friends list, who may never see your brands page, or even know it exists. And if there isn't, then get your
                friends to help support your brand and share the post as well, reaching into their social circles.</p>
            <p>These small gestures can often have a big impact on business and help get your engagement up in a fairly organic
                way. While these are not the only ways to improve your overall brand reach on Facebook, these are what I
                consider to be essential to spreading your brand without going into the world of paid Facebook Advertisements.</p>
            <p>I suggest trying one or two of these strategies, and see how they impact your engagements and your Facebook statistics.
                Analyze the data and see what works and what doesn't, rinse and repeat.</p>
