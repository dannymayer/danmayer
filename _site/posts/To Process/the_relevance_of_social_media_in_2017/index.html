            <div class="date">March 22, 2017</div>
            <hr>
            <p>Since its first inception in 2003, Facebook has gown massively, just over 1,870 million active users as of January
                2017, and has become an integral part of modern society.  Just about everybody, and their grandma, quite
                literally, play a role in some form of social media or another, whether that is Facebook, Twitter, Instagram,
                Tumblr, Snapchat, or the few who actively use Google+.  If you have a brand, a business, a band, or even
                are just trying to increase the social extent of a club or group, and you are not utilizing social media,
                you will be quickly left behind and forgotten.  Even if you are not a marketing guru, basic aptitude in social
                media and how it works can take you a long way.</p>
            <img class="medium-images" src="./images/the-relevance-of-social-media-in-2017-1-1024x1024.jpg" />
            <h2>The Big 4</h2>
            <p>Currently, in the western market, Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, and Twitter dominate social media.  Facebook by
                far has the rest beat, currently carrying about 1,870 million users, and with Instagram falling in at 600
                million shortly behind, Facebook has more active users then the other three do combined.  This graph, found
                in an article on
                <a href="http://www.smartinsights.com/social-media-marketing/social-media-strategy/new-global-social-media-research/" target="_blank">Smart Insights</a> shows just how much of a lead Facebook has over the rest of the social medias.</p>

            <img class="large-images" src="./images/top-social-network-sites-by-number-of-active-users-2017-1.png" />
            <p>Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, and Twitter all play different roles in the marketing experience, and the engagement
                and purpose of each of these are very different.
                <ul>
                    <li style="text-align: left;">Facebook - Community driven, fewer posts, more ads, promotions, discussion and engagement based.</li>
                    <li style="text-align: left;">Instagram - Brand Identity is key, hashtags to connect, reposting and engaging with followers.</li>
                    <li style="text-align: left;">Tumblr - Much like other blogs, content creation and links back to main site or page, can reinforce community,
                        discussion, and promotions like Facebook.</li>
                    <li style="text-align: left;">Twitter - Engage with followers, discover connections through use of hashtags</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Facebook is the most versatile forum for marketing through social media due to the various channels available,
                which will be discussed and broken down in a future post, and it makes sense why the engagement is so high
                compared to the other mediums of social media; however paid advertisements and complex algorithms can also
                inhibit marketing efforts, unless you know and understand how they work.</p>
            <img class="medium-images" src="./images/mobile-user-engagement.jpg" />
            <p>The way Facebook has set up Pages, Messenger, and Groups explains how and why the engagement levels are consistently
                much higher than these other social networks, and while Facebook seems very prevalent, these other social
                networks should not be ignored, but rather leveraged in different ways to utilize all the different ways
                these networks engage their users.</p>
            <h2>Future Prospects of Social Networks</h2>
            <p>2016 seen the ideas Snapchat initially brought to the table flourish, and then be picked up by Facebook, Instagram,
                and Twitter.  Small, short-form videos, with actual live engagement, versus fabricated videos and content,
                as a way to engage potential customers is going to continue to develop as we proceed through the rest of
                2017.
            </p>
            <p>Live broadcasting on all of these networks will also continue to flourish for the same reasons. The notion that
                potential customers can be engaged with behind the scenes content, the real work behind products, and get
                real-time "sneak peaks" of what may be to come will destroy the old advertised style of commercials and videos
                where everything is perfect and edited.  The customer wants to know what they are really getting themselves
                into, and by being the person to show them the real deal, you will cut out any worry they may have.  The
                "live" feature of Facebook, Instagram, and Periscope for Twitter will continue to flourish and I believe
                Snapchat will also start a way of Live hosting, as well as continue to develop their short videos with limited
                availability.
            </p>
            <p>I also think that Twitter will go back to a higher level of engagement between consumer and business, and a way
                for consumers with similar interests to connect and engage with each other, Hashtags, at least for Twitter,
                will more than likely disappear, staying primarily relevant in Avenues such as Instagram where the tie to
                branding can be more pronounced.</p>
            <p>Overall, Social Media and Social Networks are in the early stages of reform.  The ideas and principles that they
                were initially built upon are changing rapidly, and the way people are engaged and stay engaged on these
                networks is changing as well.  A year from now, these networks will look and act completely different as
                new avenues are opened, but one thing is for certain, Social Media is certainly not a dying breed, merely
                changing.
