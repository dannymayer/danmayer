            <h1 class="blog-title"> The Buyer's Journey</h1>
            <h2 class="secondary-title"> And how understanding it can help you increase sales</h2>
            <div class="date">April 18, 2017</div>
            <hr>
            <p>The Buyer's Journey is an incredibly useful concept to help better understand the motivation behind a consumer's
                purchases and how previous and future experiences will shape and affect decisions differently. It can be
                a useful tool to gather information from your customers and map out what their journey, and therefore their
                experience, is like on your site, and it provides a good reference point for improvements during various
                points of a sale.</p>

            <h3> What does the typical buyer journey look like?</h3>
            <p>There are three stages a buyer goes through when on their journey:
                <ol>
                    <li>Awareness Stage</li>
                    <li>Consideration Stage</li>
                    <li>Decision Stage</li>
                </ol>
                <img class="medium-images float-right" src="./images/buyer-journey.png">
            </p>


            <p>The
                <b>Awareness Stage</b> is when the consumer becomes aware of a problem that needs to be solved. This could be
                as simple as dishes need to be done, but they do not have any soap to wash the dishes, or more complex, like
                needing a computer that will be strong enough to handle professional applications and built well enough that
                it will be a long lasting computer for them to use.</p>
            <p>The consumer then moves to the
                <b>Consideration Stage</b>, where they will then research, and gather as much information about products that
                can provide a solution to their problem as they can, in most cases. Depending on the scope of the product,
                this Stage will look different. There will obviously be much more thought and consideration put into the
                purchase of a computer, then for the purchase of dish soap. Various factors will be considered during this
                stage, such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>Brand loyalty</li>
                    <li>Pricing</li>
                    <li>Prior experience</li>
                    <li>Sales</li>
                    <li>Popularity</li>
                    <li>Form and Function</li>
                    <li>Quality</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>After narrowing down their choices through research, the buyer comes to the end of their journey at the
                <b>Decision Stage</b>. At this stage, the buyer will make their final decision for a product to purchase, as
                well as go through post-purchase satisfaction or dissatisfaction. This is the stage where consumers also
                develop brand loyalty and wil determine if they will become a repeat buyer or not.</p>
            <h3> Consumer Conversion and Experience</h3>
            <p>The Consideration stage is one of the most important stages for marketers. This is the stage where all the efforts
                put behind a brand or product will come to fruition, and hopefully intrigue and influence the customer to
                convert. But it does not end there, the Decision Stage is equally important as this stage will cause a customer
                to avoid a product or brand or convert to a repeat buyer. User experience is imperative at this stage, particularly
                in the e-commerce realm.
            </p>
            <p>If a customer has a bad experience, or finds it difficult to navigate a site or complete a purchase, they may
                decide to change their mind on what product they will buy, or swear off the brand or product for good. With
                markets getting increasingly over saturated, anything less then the absolute best possible experience will
                put you well behind the mark as far as your customers are concerned. You could have the price of a product
                beat by half, but if they struggle to purchase an item, cannot get a hold of a real person for questions,
                or are put off in any other way, they will go somewhere else.</p>
            <p> A good tactic to track user experience is to create a roadmap to visualize the experience your customers are
                having. You can do this through prediction, putting yourself in the shoes of your buyer personas to try and
                emulate problems that specific targeted people may have, or through data collection of actual buyers and
                purchasers. Doing a combination of both will give you the highest advantage in regards to understanding your
                user experience, as well as establishing wins and opportunities.</p>

            <img class="medium-images" src="./images/buyer-story.png">

            <p>The idea is that you track the exact steps a consumer has from the initial idea of purchasing your product until
                the receiving and using of your product and monitor for peaks and valleys. In the above example, a consumer
                is interested n a product, but cannot receive any social proof, so we experience the first valley, and then
                later has an issue with the product, which requires it to be repaired, but ultimately, in this case, the
                good outweighs the bad, and the consumer enjoys the product enough to recommend it.</p>
            <p>By performing these audits with buyer personas and actual consumers, a company can track the good and bad and
                learn where to better focus their efforts with user experience. To learn more about buyer personas, you can
                read an article I wrote about them
                <a href="./how_to_create_buyer_personas.html">here</a>. Making the map have as little valleys as possible is obviously ideal, and having input from multiple
                sources is the best way to determine if you are on the right track for having an all around easily accessible
                product. I challenge everyone to create a consumer journey map, and utilize it, and share in the comments
                what they have found. Identify your wins and opportunities and the changes you can make to turn those valleys
                into peaks on your maps for your customers.</p>
