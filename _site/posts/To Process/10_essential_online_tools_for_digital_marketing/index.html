            <h1 class="blog-title">10 Essential Online Tools for Digital Marketing</h1>
            <div class="date">May 04, 2017</div>
            <hr>
            <p>Digital marketers spend a lot of time online, it is the nature of the business.  Below I have listed 10 online
                tools that I find absolutely essential in my efforts in digital marketing.</p>
            <h2>1. Canva</h2>
            <img class="large-images" src="./images/canva.png" />

            <p>
                <a href="http://canva.com">Canva</a> is an excellent tool to use for those who are not graphic design saavy.  Canva allows you to create
                graphics with relative ease with tons of templates and vectors to choose from, most of them free.</p>
            <h3>How I Use:</h3>
            <p>When I need to mock up graphics relatively quickly, or I am looking for a quick, yet interesting way to display
                data, I turn to Canva to help me out.  Alternatively, if i I am feeling uninspired, I will build off a prebuilt
                template in Canva.
            </p>
            <h2>2. Google Analytics</h2>
            <p>
                <a href="http://analytics.google.com">Google Analytics</a> is the staple of what Digital Marketers do.  It provides all of the insights you need
                to track your website and even includes e-commerce analytics as well.</p>
            <h3>How I Use:</h3>
            <p>From tracking the amount of traffic to my website, to learning more about who visits my website and targeting
                key demographics, Google Analytics is the cornerstone of digital marketing.</p>
            <h2>3. Hemingway</h2>
            <img class="large-images" src="./images/hemingway.png" />

            <p>
                <a href="http://Hemingwayapp.com">Hemingway</a> is a content editor that checks for grammar and formatting, allows for direct publication to
                Wordpress and Medium, or export to Microsoft Word or a PDF file, and even allows for direct export to HTML
                formatting, and it grades readability.  For content creation, and as a plain text editor, this application
                is a must.</p>
            <h3>How I Use:</h3>
            <p>I create all of my written content in Hemingway.  It allows me to actively see mistakes, as well as aids in the
                wording and formatting of my content.  Of all my tools I use in marketing, and with the shift to content
                marketing as king for visibility, Hemingway is absolutely essential for text editing.</p>
            <h2>4. SEO Powersuite</h2>
            <p>
                <a href="http://seopowersuite.com">Seo Powersuite</a> is a SEO Tool kit which contains 5 different apps:
                <ul>
                    <li>WebSite Auditor</li>
                    <li>Buzz Bundle</li>
                    <li>SEO SpyGlass</li>
                    <li>Link Assistant</li>
                    <li>Rank Tracker</li>
                </ul>
                There are three different options, including a free option for SEO Powersuite, and none of them are subscription based, which
                is primarily how all SEO tools come, yet they continue to update and stay relevant.</p>
            <h3>How I Use:</h3>
            I use SEO Powersuite for quick references in my SEO campaigns.  The suite of tools that comes with it covers just about all
            the ground you need when auditing and researching SEO for a website.  In addition, SEO Powersuite is easy to
            use, breaks down all of the results, and links out to help define some of the jargon used in the reports.
            <h2>5. Wordpress</h2>
            <p>
                <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> is an easy to use, yet very advanced web page builder.  Primarily used for blogs, Wordpress
                can be used to build any number of different types of websites using custom plug ins, and requires little
                to no knowledge of coding using its themes and interface in place of standard HTML web building.</p>
            <h3>How I Use:</h3>
            <p>I use Wordpress to build websites, simple as that.  Everything I need is on page, and is just as simple or as
                advanced as I need it to be.</p>
            <h2>6. Mailchimp</h2>
            <img class="large-images" src="./images/mailchimp.png" />

            <p>
                <a href="http://mailchimp.com">Mailchimp</a> is an email subscriber list manager and automation platform.  Mailchimp can be easily used
                to build and manage mailing lists and is free up to 2,000 subscribers.  Mailchimp also provides a number
                of templates and tools to help you build your mailing list, and keep them subscribed.  It is an excellent
                tool for just starting out.
            </p>
            <h3>How I Use:</h3>
            <p>I use Mailchimp for everything email related.  When building lists, and sending out notifications and information,
                and automating emails, Mailchimp is the easiest to use, and provides a great set of analytics and an easy
                to use mobile app.</p>
            <h2>7. Evernote</h2>
            <p>
                <a href="http://evernote.com">Evernote</a> is, essentially, a giant collection of online notebooks.  Evernote allows you to take notes,
                clip articles, import images and scans, and share all of this information with ease.</p>
            <h3>How I Use:</h3>
            <p>I use Evernote in a few different ways.  I save articles I want to read, or that I find interesting into Evernote
                to read later.  I also utilize notebooks for school, work, notes on conferences or books, and as a way to
                track ideas for blogs, ad campaigns, and web designs.  I also utilize Evernote as a way to store copies of
                key performance indicators that I track so I can easily reference back when I need to.</p>
            <h2>8. Grammarly</h2>
            <p>
                <a href="http://grammarly.com">Grammarly</a> is an application, similar to Hemingway, that checks grammar.  The best part of Grammarly is
                not the text editor, but the browser add-on's that you can enable which will have Grammarly constantly checking
                for grammar as you write and communicate on the web.</p>
            <h3>How I Use:</h3>
            <p>When writing emails, Facebook posts, or commenting on blogs, I always have Grammarly enabled in whatever browser
                I decide to use that week, to ensure that I do not make any grammar mistakes and can consistently communicate
                in a professional manner.
            </p>
            <h2>9. Buzzsumo</h2>
            <img class="large-images" src="./images/buzzsumo.png" />

            <p>
                <a href="http://buzzsumo.com">Buzzsumo</a> is a website that allows you to analyze content.  You can type in a keyword or web address,
                and Buzzsumo will analyze social media shares, important influencers on a topic, track backlinks, and even
                show trending topics in a certain set of keywords.</p>
            <h3>How I Use:</h3>
            <p>I use Buzzsumo to research keywords and determine what content should be created.  I also use the trend analysis
                when planning blog posts to determine where I should focus my efforts.  Buzzsumo is also great for tracking
                backlinks of others in my niche that I am focusing on, and gathering more information on the key influencers
                my clients should try targeting when building backlinks.</p>
            <h2>10. IFTTT</h2>
            <img class="large-images" src="./images/ifttt.png" />

            <p>IFTTT, or If This, Then That, is an automation tool that has many different applications, particularly on mobile,
                but for the case of digital marketing, is great for using on social media accounts to streamline and sync
                posts and data.</p>
            <h3>How I Use:</h3>
            <p>I use IFTTT to streamline social media.  I have systems set up to tweet when I upload to Instagram, natively,
                as well as automation with Facebook likes, Twitter mentions, Instagram follows, and so on.  It takes a lot
                of the effort out of maintaining social media accounts, and makes it as simple as setting up what you want
                done.
            </p>

            <p>While these are not certainly the only tools, these are what I find myself using more often then others when
                I am working on marketing.</p>
